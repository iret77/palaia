# Changelog

## [2.0.2] — 2026-03-18

### Summary
Consolidation release for Palaia 2.0. Includes the full v2.0 feature set (Auto-Capture, Auto-Recall, LLM-based extraction, session-isolated TurnState, significance tagging, knowledge packages, temporal queries, bounded GC) plus all post-release fixes.

### Fixes since 2.0.0
- SKILL.md plugin install step corrected.
- Fastembed cache integrity fix.
- `captureModel` resilience — graceful fallback when configured model is unavailable.
- Sliding window fix for turn counting in Auto-Capture.
- npm plugin version sync.
- All version references aligned (pyproject.toml, package.json, __init__.py, SKILL.md).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-17

### Breaking Changes
- **Palaia 2.0 is OpenClaw-specific.** Plugin architecture replaces standalone hooks. The CLI still works standalone for manual `palaia write`/`palaia query`, but Auto-Capture and Auto-Recall require the OpenClaw plugin.
- Plugin config path is now `plugins.entries.palaia.config` (not `plugins.config.palaia`).
- Default `captureMinTurns` changed from 2 to 1 in plugin config.

### Features
- **Auto-Capture** (`agent_end` hook) — Automatically captures significant conversation exchanges as memory entries after each agent session. No manual `palaia write` required.
- **Auto-Recall** (`before_prompt_build` hook) — Automatically injects relevant memories into agent context before each prompt. No manual `palaia query` required.
- **LLM-based Extraction** — Uses a cheap embedded LLM (e.g. claude-haiku-4, gpt-4.1-mini, gemini-2.0-flash) to extract structured knowledge from conversations. Falls back to rule-based extraction if unavailable.
- **Session-isolated TurnState** — Per-session state tracking prevents cross-contamination in multi-agent setups.
- **Emoji Reactions (Slack)** — Brain emoji (recall) and floppy disk emoji (capture) on messages when memory is used.
- **Capture Hints** — Agents can include `<palaia-hint project="X" scope="Y" />` in responses to guide Auto-Capture metadata.
- **Adaptive Nudging with Graduation** — CLI nudges agents toward best practices (--type, --tags). Nudges graduate after 3 consecutive successes. Regression detection re-activates them.
- **Significance Tagging** — 7 tags auto-detected: decision, lesson, surprise, commitment, correction, preference, fact.
- **Knowledge Packages** — `palaia package export/import` for portable knowledge transfer between environments.
- **Temporal Queries** — `palaia query --before <date> --after <date>` for time-filtered search.
- **Cross-Project Queries** — `palaia query --cross-project` searches across all projects.
- **Process Runner** — `palaia process run <id>` for interactive execution of stored process entries.
- **Bounded GC** — `palaia gc --dry-run --budget <n>` for controlled, predictable garbage collection.
- **`/palaia-status` Command** — OpenClaw slash command showing recall count, store stats, and config summary.
- **Memory Footnotes** — Agent responses include source attribution when memories are used.
- **Capture Confirmations** — Visual feedback when exchanges are saved to memory.

### Migration from 1.x
- Run `palaia doctor --fix` to migrate configuration from 1.x to 2.0.
- New config keys (`captureModel`, `captureMinSignificance`, `captureScope`, `captureProject`, `captureMinTurns`, `captureFrequency`) are auto-added with sensible defaults.
- Existing entries are fully preserved — no data migration required.
- The OpenClaw plugin config schema now includes all capture-related keys.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-03-14

### Features
- **Gemini embedding provider** — `gemini-embedding-exp-03-07` via REST API, no SDK dependency. Cloud-based embeddings with local fallback support. (#34)
- **Exact filtering for `palaia list`** — `--status`, `--tag`, `--priority` now use exact matching instead of embedding search. (#37)
- **Doctor checks for unread memos** — `palaia doctor` warns when unread memos are waiting. (#42)
- **Doctor checks for newer Palaia version on PyPI** — `palaia doctor` now detects when a newer version is available. (#45)
- **Improved OpenClaw config auto-detection** — Better detection on VPS installs where config paths differ from standard setups. (#51)
- **Concurrent write safety validated** — 5 thread-based tests confirm WAL + file locking handles parallel writes correctly. (#52)

### Bug Fixes
- **Warmup/indexing now includes private and shared-scope entries** — Previously, warmup only indexed team-scope entries. (#60)
- **`doctor --fix` respects explicit user embedding config** — No longer overwrites user-configured embedding chains during auto-fix. (#57)
- **postUpdate npm graceful fallback** — npm upgrade step in postUpdate hook no longer fails if npm is not available.

### Security
- **Scope enforcement audit** — All read/write operations verified for correct scope enforcement. (#39)

### Documentation
- Rewrote README with sales-pitch-first approach
- Added Agent Field Guide with production lessons
- Added Gemini provider to SKILL.md provider table
- Documented concurrent write safety guarantees

## [1.8.1] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Critical: search.py now respects embedding_chain config** — Previously always used `auto_detect_provider()`, ignoring the configured chain. With both sentence-transformers and fastembed installed, queries took 14-18s instead of 2s because the slower provider was always selected. (#49)

### Added
- **Warmup now builds embedding index** — `palaia warmup` pre-computes embeddings for all entries (batch processing, progress display). Queries after warmup use cached embeddings instead of recomputing on every call. Reduces query time from 14s to <2s. (#48)
- **Status shows warmup hint** — `palaia status` now shows "Index: 0/23 — 23 entries not indexed. Run: palaia warmup" instead of just "Index: 0/23". (#47)
- **`palaia skill` command** — Prints the embedded SKILL.md documentation. Works without `palaia init`. Useful for pip-only installations without ClawHub.
- **MANIFEST.in** — SKILL.md, CHANGELOG.md, and LICENSE now included in PyPI source tarball.
- **Setup verification step** in SKILL.md — Mandatory Step 5: test query must return results in <5s before setup is considered complete.
- **`palaia migrate --suggest`** now part of standard setup flow (Step 3 in SKILL.md).

## [1.8.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Process Nudge** — After `palaia write` and `palaia query`, Palaia now checks for relevant process entries and surfaces them: "Related process: Release Checklist (palaia get 74bba31a)". Uses hybrid matching (embedding similarity + tag overlap). Frequency-limited (max 1 nudge per process per hour). Suppressed in `--json` mode. Gracefully degrades to tag-only matching when no embedding provider is available.
- **"What Goes Where" guide** in SKILL.md — Clear boundary between project files (static facts) and Palaia (dynamic knowledge). Helps agents avoid duplicating knowledge across files and Palaia entries.
- **Reconciliation guide** in SKILL.md — Best practices for agents working in environments with pre-Palaia memory patterns (CONTEXT.md, MEMORY.md). Gradual migration without breaking existing workflows.

## [1.7.3] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Frictionless init** — `palaia init` without `--agent` now works, defaulting to agent name "default". Single-agent systems no longer need to specify a name.
- **Single-agent auto-detect** — If an OpenClaw config with exactly one agent is found, the name is used automatically: "Auto-detected agent: HAL (from OpenClaw config)".
- **Agent alias system** — `palaia config set-alias default HAL` makes queries for "HAL" also return entries written as "default". Enables clean single→multi-agent migration without rewriting entries.
- **Doctor auto-fix for embedding chains** — `palaia doctor --fix` now actively repairs broken embedding chains: attempts pip install of missing providers, falls back to best available, runs warmup. BM25-only is last resort.
- **Doctor alias nudge** — Warns when "default" entries exist alongside named agents without an alias configured.

### Fixed
- **Init without --agent no longer misleading** — Previously said "Initialized" then immediately "Not initialized" on next command. Now either succeeds with default name or gives clear error.
- **Copyright year** — CLI header now shows "(c) 2026 byte5 GmbH".

## [1.7.1] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Test fixtures missing agent identity** — CLI integration tests in `test_locking.py`, `test_project.py`, and `test_ux_improvements.py` now set `agent` in their `palaia_root` fixtures, fixing 18 test failures caused by the init gatekeeper (PR #44) blocking store commands without prior `palaia init --agent`.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Entry Classes** — New `type` frontmatter field: `memory` (default), `process`, `task`. Existing entries without type default to `memory`.
- **Structured Task Fields** — `status` (open|in-progress|done|wontfix), `priority` (critical|high|medium|low), `assignee`, `due_date` for task entries.
- **`palaia edit`** — Edit existing entries: content, tags, title, and all task fields. WAL-backed, scope-enforced.
- **Session Identities** — New `instance` frontmatter field for distinguishing sessions of the same agent. Auto-set via `PALAIA_INSTANCE` env var.
- **Structured Query Filters** — `palaia query --type task --status open --priority high --assignee Elliot --instance Claw-Palaia`. Exact match, not embeddings.
- **Structured List Filters** — `palaia list --type task --status open --priority high --assignee --instance`.
- **Agent Nudging** — CLI hints after writes without `--type`. `palaia status` shows entry class breakdown with task status summary. Hints are frequency-limited and suppressed in JSON output.
- **`palaia migrate --suggest`** — Scan existing entries and suggest type assignments based on content heuristics.
- **Doctor entry class check** — `palaia doctor` detects untyped entries and suggests migration.

### Changed
- **`palaia status`** — Shows entry class breakdown (memory/process/task counts) and task status summary.
- **`palaia write`** — Accepts `--type`, `--status`, `--priority`, `--assignee`, `--due-date`, `--instance`.
- **Search results** — Include `type`, `status`, `priority`, `assignee`, `due_date`, `instance` fields when present.

### Security
- **Scope enforcement on edit** — Private entries can only be edited by the owning agent. No scope escalation possible. Non-negotiable.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **CLI copyright header** — All commands now display "(c) byte5 GmbH" in the header.
- **HuggingFace warning suppression** — Noisy HF warnings silenced during query/warmup.
- **Version sync** — All references (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, SKILL.md) bumped to 1.6.1.

### Fixed
- **Arrow character mismatch** — test_chain_cli.py updated for new UI arrow characters.

### Published
- ClawHub v1.6.1

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **palaia/ui.py** — Box-drawing table renderer, header, and formatting helpers. No external dependencies.
- **Unified CLI header** — Every command now shows a consistent header.

### Changed
- **All emojis removed** from CLI output for a professional look.
- **Commands overhauled** — status, doctor, list, query, detect, project, warmup, memo inbox all use the new UI.
- **--json flag** unchanged (machine output unaffected).

### Updated
- Tests updated for new output format.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Store discovery fallback chain** — `find_palaia_root()` now checks `~/.palaia` and `~/.openclaw/workspace/.palaia` as fallbacks when cwd walk fails. Users no longer get "No .palaia directory found" when running from outside the workspace. (#33)
- **Doctor OpenClaw config detection** — Now checks `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG` env var, `.yml` extension, and falls back to parsing `openclaw status` output. Fixes false "standalone mode" reports when OpenClaw plugin is active. (#33)

### Changed
- **Default install recommendation** — `palaia[fastembed]` replaces bare `palaia` in all install instructions (SKILL.md, README). Users get semantic search out of the box. (#33)

### Added
- **PEP 668 troubleshooting** — SKILL.md documents workarounds for Debian/Ubuntu "externally-managed-environment" errors (`--user`, `--break-system-packages`, `pipx`, venv). (#33)

## [1.5.1] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Version sync** — pyproject.toml, __init__.py, SKILL.md all at 1.5.1.
- **Doctor --fix auto-repair** — Embedding chain auto-fix works correctly.
- **pip fallback** — SKILL.md documents pip alternatives.
- **Plugin config docs** — Correct config path documented.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-13

- **`PALAIA_HOME` env variable** — Override `.palaia` store location. Plugin runner sets it automatically. (#23)

### Fixed
- OpenClaw plugin now finds `.palaia` store reliably regardless of working directory. (#23)
